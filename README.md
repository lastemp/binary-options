# binary-options

This is a binary-options program developed as a Rust Smart Contract(running on Solana Blockchain and is my WBA Capstone project (https://www.web3builders.dev/), 
It enables participants to either make a long position or short position against cryptocurrencyâ€™s strike price. 
The smart contract communicates to Pyth Oracles to get prices feeds which are used to determine the participant who made the correct prediction.

Below are some basic features contained in the program:

- Initialize
- Create Binary Options
- Accept Binary Options
- Process Prediction
- Withdraw Participant Funds
- Withdraw House Funds

## Getting started

In order to run this example program you will need to install Rust and
Solana. Information about installing Rust can be found
[here](https://rustup.rs/) and information about installing Solana can
be found [here](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools).

Once you've completed the Solana installation run the following
commands to configure you machine for local development:

```
solana config set --url localhost
solana-keygen new
```

These two commands create Solana config files in `~/.config/solana/`
which solana command line tools will read in to determine what cluster
to connect to and what keypair to use.

Having done that run a local Solana validator by running:

```
solana-test-validator
```

This program must be left running in the background.

## Deploying the Solana program

To deploy the Solana program in this repository to the Solana cluster
that you have configured run:

```
anchor deploy
```

## Running the test program

To run the test program you must have already deployed the Solana
program. The test program sends a transaction to the Solana
blockchain asking it to execute the deployed program and reports the
results.

```
anchor test --skip-local-validator
```
